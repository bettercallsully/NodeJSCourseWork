            <h1>The Act of Starting</h1>

            <p><strong>KEYWORD</strong>
                <p>Starting. Starting that diet, starting that podcast, starting that blog, putting forth the extra foot forward to achieving our own personal endeavours. As humans, we dream, we wish. But what also makes us humans is the amazing ability to achieve those dreams, and create what we once pictured in our minds to hold that dream in the palm of our hands.
                    It's God-given, but with that being said, not everyone prevails in their own perception on how they think they should or could be living... Take a moment to think about that for a second.
                    Some of us... A lot of us to be accurate, don't ever get the chance to live how we think we should.
                    To add another perspective, some say life is a simulation... Our brain is a powerful powerhouse, it generates data when light passes through the cornea and lens which both then process the world as we see it to photo-receptors called the retina. Those times you daydream wishing you could be doing something else, visualizing a better lifestyle.</p>

                    <strong>YOU NEED TO START DOING.</strong>

                <p><strong>5 Minute Plea To Do</strong></p>
                    <blockquote><strong>"The Key to content success, is that you have to start documenting instead of creating." - Gary Vee</strong></blockquote>
            <hr>
            <p>I have fell victim to the procrastination, the excuses, the feeling of not knowing where to start. Wanting to be known for a specific skill, wanting to express yourself through your own outlets, based on your own knowledge and what you've learned.

                    <p><em>Jordan Peterson is a Canadian clinical psychologist and a professor of psychology.</em></p>
                    <blockquote>Jordan Peterson says...<strong><br>“You must determine where you are going in your life, because you cannot get there unless you move in that direction. Random wandering will not move you forward. It will instead disappoint and frustrate you and make you anxious and unhappy and hard to get along with (and then resentful, and then vengeful, and then worse.”</strong></blockquote>
                    <p>And knowing what you want to do is very key... Were all so young in our bodies and minds. We all want to 'make sure" we don't need a plan B... We very much like to stick to plan A.
                    Our imagination blossoms, and creates these amazing ideas and visions that we are the sole control of. But ideas, or just ideas... Dreams are just...Dreams.
                    It's what we do as strongwilled beings to actually manifest those ideas. And with channelling, those ideas we stand before failure, pain, and require consistency before we can ever prevail.</p>

                    <p>Personal life comes into play, financial drawbacks, supportive mishaps. We fall prey to the ever vicious circle. We begin doubling back, going back to things that distract us. While we tell our peers "I'm working on it"
                            <br>Thus we never actually 'start' ANYTHING, we put things off and leave them for later. Procrastinate until, the procrastination, becomes additional procrastination.</p>

                            <blockquote><p>“Procrastination is like masturbation. At first it feels good, but in the end you’re only screwing yourself.”</p></blockquote>

                            <br>
                            <p>At some point, we need to stop resorting to motivational videos, speeches, books, knowledge has to be put into action.
                            It's not always about you either, other people learn from our natural ability to bring great visionary ideas into our physical dimension. Our ideas, thoughts... Are not of this world.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p><strong>It's almost Godlike</strong><p>That's why you are selling yourself short when you do not act on those ambitions. Starting is the act of moving towards your will. And as humans, the strongest thing we are given is our will.</p>
                            <span style="color:blueviolet;">Start Today, Start Now</span>
