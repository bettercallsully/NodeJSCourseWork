<p><strong>The one thing I was always told was to be transparent. Even if that means transparently nieve.</strong>
  was never a big fan of school. But I always loved, computers... 2003, My Mom bought out first computer deksptop.
I went nuts, had a virus on the thing a few hours later. But always liked the process of resvoling those situations, soon enough I knew
what I need to prevent myself from <strong>destroying</strong> our computers, but my curioisty did'nt stop there.
<br>
<br>
I decided, "okay, my computer is secure. I have the programs my family needs... But what does this do?" I installed a ton of games, a ton of songs.
Back when Limewire was a thing.. I soon got into, inspecting the pages I was on on a daily basis, and I quickly realized.. "Oh, all of this text translates to what I'm loading on my broswer every day" I soon began hacking the HTML to my favorite games, and re-routing the servers to server I.P's of my own.
It became fun... I honestly did'nt understand what I was doing, the seriousness of the troubles I could be getting into, I soon learned how to use the Command Terminal, fixing boot sequences and files using certain commands for hours at at a time, everyday.
<br>
<br>
I saw other people were doing,
so I began doing it my own way. 
I kept breaking all of the computers my Mom kept bringing home just so I could break em and fix em for projects. I just needing something to do on my spare time. From the trials and tribulations of having to create my own loader for games, and creating many of my own websites. I quickly gave it up... Seriously, I stopped doing it. I was more a athletic driven kid when I was younger, all of my focus was on skateboarding and football.
<span style="color:red;"> Fast forward 13 years later, with an even stronger love for tech, I decided to jump into full force. 100%, and make this my career choice. The things I once dreaded, mathematics, arithmetics, and problem solving. I love and understand today.</span>
They keep me sharp, I can think quicker now that I love to learn. I find myself reading for 3-4 hours a day, without even batting an eye. I like collaberating with other like minded individuals that also love to learn.
And that is my goals on my journey as a Software Engineer. </p>
